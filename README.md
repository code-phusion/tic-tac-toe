# CodePhusion Tic-Tac-Toe with AI

Welcome to the CodePhusion Tic-Tac-Toe project! This repository contains a tic-tac-toe game developed by the talented developers at CodePhusion during their free time. The primary goal of this project is to delve into the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by implementing advanced algorithms like Minimax and Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning, making the game not only challenging but also efficient.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using a powerful combination of technologies:

- **Backend:** Java with Spring Boot - For robust back-end services and AI logic implementation.
- **Frontend:** React - To provide an interactive and responsive user interface.
- **AI Algorithms:**
  - Minimax Algorithm - Powers the foundational AI opponent logic.
  - Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning - Enhances the efficiency of the AI by reducing the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.

## About the Project

Tic-tac-toe is a classic game that has been enjoyed by people of all ages. In this version, we've integrated an AI opponent that uses sophisticated algorithms to calculate its moves. This project serves as an educational tool for developers interested in understanding AI in game development, specifically in how algorithms like Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning can be applied to create intelligent and efficient game strategies.

## Features

- **Classic Tic-Tac-Toe Gameplay:** Enjoy the beloved n x n (up to 50) grid game with a modern twist.
- **Advanced AI Opponent:** Face off against an AI opponent that employs Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning for faster decision-making.
- **Educational Tool:** Explore the implementation of complex AI algorithms in a simple, engaging game environment.
